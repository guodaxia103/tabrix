# Tabrix Task Roadmap (Stage 3a → 5e)

> **Version**: `v1.0.0` (2026-04-21) — companion to [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md).
> **Language**: English (canonical). Chinese mirror: [`TASK_ROADMAP_zh.md`](./TASK_ROADMAP_zh.md).
> **Status**: `Active / Execution plan SoT (Stage level)`.
> **Supersedes**: the roadmap portion of [`MKEP_STAGE_3_PLUS_ROADMAP.md`](./MKEP_STAGE_3_PLUS_ROADMAP.md). That file stays as a historical reference; this one is the live plan.
> **Sprint executor**: [`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`](./PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md) — every Stage on this page maps to one or more `B-*` items over there.

## 0. How to Use This Document

If you are a new AI assistant picking up work on Tabrix, read in this order:

1. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — development rules.
2. [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md) — product identity + hard constraints.
3. **This file** — which Stage is live, what is next, what is off-limits.
4. [`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`](./PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md) — the `B-*` you can grab this week.

Each Stage below has a fixed template:

- **ID & name** — `Stage <id>`, e.g. `Stage 3a`.
- **MKEP layer** — `M` / `K` / `E` / `P` / `X` (cross-cutting).
- **KPI** — which of the five North-Star dimensions the Stage moves (`省 token` · `更快` · `更准` · `更稳` · `懂用户`).
- **Priority / Size / Dependencies** — `P0..P2` · `S/M/L/XL` · upstream Stages.
- **Scope** — what is in.
- **Non-scope** — what is explicitly out (to keep the Stage finishable).
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** — the hard completion signal.
- **Linked `B-*`** — sprint items that deliver the Stage.
- **Notes for incoming AI** — traps, conventions, and invariants to respect.

When in doubt: **do not expand scope without updating this file first**. Scope creep is the most common source of stuck Stages.

## 1. Wave Map (Dependency Overview)

```
Wave 1 — near-term, parallelizable. Starts unblocked.
  Stage 3a · Knowledge UI Map + stable targetRef      [B-010 done; B-011 v1 done]
  Stage 3d · read_page(render='markdown')             [B-015 v1 done]
  Stage 3g · API Knowledge (XHR/fetch capture)        [B-017 v1 done]    ← biggest K1 lever (data side); call-side deferred
  Stage 3f · Policy capability opt-in enum            [B-016 v1 done]    capability allowlist landed; v1 ships only `api_knowledge`

Wave 2 — needs Wave 1 to be at least Beta.
  Stage 3b · Experience action-path replay            [B-005 schema done, B-012 done, B-013 done, B-EXP-REPLAY-V1 v1 landed (V24-01)]
  Stage 3c · Recovery Watchdog consolidation          [B-014 pool]

Wave 3 — strategic payoff; needs Waves 1+2.
  Stage 3h · Context Strategy Selector                [B-018 v1 slice done]  ← biggest K1 lever (planning side); v1 = rule-based selector, full Stage 3h DoD still open
  Stage 3e · Run History UI                           [B-001..B-006 DONE; Sprint 1+2]
  Stage 3i · Memory Insights table                    [B-019 pool]

Wave 4 — user-value amplification.
  Stage 4a · Experience import/export + PII redact    [B-020 pool]
  Stage 4b · Policy dynamic context                   [no B yet]
  Stage 4c · Douyin + cross-site family migration     [no B yet]

Wave 5 — long horizon, no dates.
  Stage 5a · Experience self-learning writeback
  Stage 5b · Knowledge Graph upgrade
  Stage 5c · WebMCP Bridge
  Stage 5d · Experience Marketplace
  Stage 5e · Personal userPreference layer
```

**Cross-cutting (non-Stage) tracks** that run in parallel with any Wave:

- Tool-contract correctness — [`CLICK_CONTRACT_REPAIR_V1.md`](./CLICK_CONTRACT_REPAIR_V1.md) (B-023 done; next tool contracts TBD).
- Infrastructure guardrails — bundle-size gate (B-007, B-021), schema-cite rule (B-009), testing conventions (B-008).

## 2. Stage 3a · Knowledge UI Map + Stable `targetRef`

- **Layer**: `K`
- **KPI**: `更准` · `更稳` · `省 token`
- **Priority**: `P0` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: none
- **Status**: **v1 done** — UI Map schema + GitHub seed + lookup landed in `B-010`; stable `targetRef` v1 landed in `B-011` (extension HVO emits `tgt_<10-hex>`, click bridge resolves stable→snapshot ref via per-tab registry, real-browser golden path acceptance is green). UI Map consumer cutover (item 6) still pending.

### Scope

1. `KnowledgeUIMapRule { siteId, pageRole, purpose, region?, locatorHints[], actionType?, confidence? }` with hint kinds `aria_name | label_regex | href_regex | css`. Landed in `B-010`.
2. `compileKnowledgeRegistry` compiles + indexes UI map rules by `(siteId, pageRole, purpose)`; duplicate triples are rejected at compile time. Landed in `B-010`.
3. `lookup/resolve-ui-map.ts` exposing `lookupUIMapRule` / `listUIMapRulesForPage` / `listUIMapRulesForSite`. Landed in `B-010`.
4. GitHub seed: the first five purposes — `repo_home.open_issues_tab`, `repo_home.open_actions_tab`, `issues_list.new_issue_cta`, `issues_list.search_input`, `actions_list.filter_input`. Landed in `B-010`.
5. `read_page` HVO output gains **stable `targetRef`** so upstream LLMs can reference the same HVO across reloads — landed in `B-011` v1. Final shape is `tgt_<10-hex>` derived from `cyrb53(pageRole | objectSubType | role | normalizedLabel | hrefPathBucket | ordinal)`; the `historyRef + hvoIndex + contentHash` direction in earlier docs proved fragile because `historyRef` was hardcoded `null` and `hvoIndex` drifted with cosmetic list churn. The bridge (`candidate-action.ts` + `interaction.ts` + `computer.ts`) now resolves `candidateAction.targetRef = tgt_*` through a per-tab snapshot registry and fails closed with a clear "re-read first" error when the registry has no mapping (e.g. service-worker eviction or stale targetRef).
6. `candidate-action.ts` gradually migrates hardcoded locator-priority logic to consult UI Map hints. Pending (scoped behind `KNOWLEDGE_REGISTRY_MODE = on | off | diff`).

### Non-scope

- Douyin UI Map rules (Stage 4c).
- Modifying the public `read_page` DTO schema beyond adding the `targetRef` field.
- Re-wiring `candidate-action.ts` entirely — Stage 3a only lands the data lookup; consumer cutover is incremental.

### Definition of Done

- `read_page` returns stable `targetRef` that round-trips across reloads for at least 80% of HVOs on the GitHub baseline.
- `pnpm --filter @tabrix/extension test` has ≥ 15 tests covering compile / declaration order / duplicate reject / lookup / fallback.
- Knowledge Stage 1/2 existing tests all green with zero edits (no regression).
- `docs:check` clean.

### Linked `B-*`

- ✅ `B-010` — `KnowledgeUIMapRule` schema + GitHub seed + read-only lookup (done).
- ✅ `B-011` v1 — `read_page` HVO stable `targetRef` (`tgt_<10-hex>` from `cyrb53(pageRole|objectSubType|role|normalizedLabel|hrefPathBucket|ordinal)`); click bridge resolves stable→snapshot ref via per-tab registry; real-browser golden path acceptance `T5-F-GH-STABLE-TARGETREF-ROUNDTRIP` is green.

### Known limitations (B-011 v1)

These are intentional v1 boundaries — not bugs. They are written here so that B-018 v2 / Stage 3a item 6 / future readers don't assume a stronger contract than what landed.

1. **Stable `targetRef` is only end-to-end executable for ref-backed HVOs.** The per-tab snapshot registry (`stable-target-ref-registry.ts`) only records mappings when an HVO has BOTH a `targetRef` AND a per-snapshot `ref` (see the `obj.targetRef && obj.ref` guard in `read-page.ts` `recordStableTargetRefSnapshot` call). HVOs that are pure synthetic / seed-derived (no DOM anchor) may surface a `tgt_<10-hex>` for stability evidence, but a click bridge call against such a `targetRef` will fail closed (`unresolved_stable_target_ref`) — the upstream caller must pick a ref-backed HVO if it wants to drive interaction. v2 (Stage 3a item 6 / UI Map consumer cutover) is the place to broaden executable coverage.
2. **`historyRef` is a lightweight snapshot correlation id, not a strong content anchor.** The extension layer fills `historyRef = read://<host>/<pageRoleSlug>/<sha8>` (deterministic per content seed), but the native server's snapshot post-processor unconditionally overwrites the wire-level value to `memory://snapshot/<uuid>` (the SQLite snapshot row id). Upstream MCP clients therefore see a uuid, not a content hash. The B-011 stable `targetRef` does NOT depend on `historyRef` to be stable — its derivation is purely `(pageRole | objectSubType | role | normalizedLabel | hrefPathBucket | ordinal)`. Promoting `historyRef` to a true `contentHash` equivalent (so it can be a second-level anti-drift anchor) is its own follow-up, not part of B-011 v1.

### V23-02 increment — landed (unit-level guard)

The v2.3.0 mainline `V23-02` package added an explicit increment hardening on top of the B-011 v1 derivation, without redoing any of v1:

- **`tests/stable-target-ref-stability.test.ts`** pins three stability properties as named scenarios — (a) cosmetic sibling deletion (a non-identity-bearing skeleton row vanishes between two snapshots, surviving HVOs keep the same `targetRef`); (b) class / aria styling churn cannot feed identity (the builder input shape contract is pinned); (c) reload-shaped re-annotation (every per-snapshot `ref` value churns, identity tuple unchanged → same `targetRef`). It also pins the ordinal-collision contract for visually-identical siblings.
- The cross-reload, real-browser counterpart of (c) is `T5-F-GH-STABLE-TARGETREF-CROSS-RELOAD` in the `tabrix-private-tests` repo (read_page → grab `targetRef` → reload tab → read_page → assert same `targetRef` → click bridge resolves through registry). That scenario lives outside this public repo per AGENTS rule 17.
- No change to the `targetRef` derivation itself, the per-tab snapshot registry, or the click bridge — V23-02 is the regression-hardening lock on the existing v1 surface.

### V23-03 / B-015 — Markdown render path + L2 source routing landed (2026-04-22)

The v2.3.0 mainline `V23-03` package landed `read_page(render='markdown')` plus the §11.5 L2 source routing surface. This is the **first** time `B-015` ships, and it is intentionally additive — JSON-mode behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- **Shared contract**: `packages/shared/src/read-page-contract.ts` adds `ReadPageRenderMode = 'json' | 'markdown'`, extends `ReadPageExtensionFields` with `renderMode` + `markdown`, and extends `ReadPageTaskLevel2` with `domJsonRef` / `markdownRef` / `knowledgeRef` (all optional and back-compat). `packages/shared/src/tools.ts` adds the optional `render` parameter to the `chrome_read_page` MCP input schema.
- **Extension**: `app/chrome-extension/entrypoints/background/tools/browser/read-page.ts` validates the new `render` param (fail-closed on unknown values) and, when `render='markdown'`, attaches a `dom_markdown` artifact ref + a Markdown projection generated by the new pure helper `read-page-markdown.ts`. The projection is intentionally `ref`/`targetRef`-free, enforcing the §4.3 invariant that Markdown is a **reading surface, not an execution surface** — JSON HVOs / `candidateActions` / stable `targetRef` remain the click/fill execution truth.
- **L2 source routing**: `read-page-task-protocol.ts` `buildLevel2` now populates `domJsonRef` from the first `dom_snapshot` artifact (always present), `markdownRef` from the explicit `markdownArtifactRef` (only when the caller asked for Markdown), and `knowledgeRef = null` (placeholder for B-017's runtime call surface). When Markdown is present, `'readable_markdown'` is also mirrored into the legacy `expansions` list for v1-shape callers.
- **Tests**: `tests/read-page-render-markdown.test.ts` pins five contract properties (header/object/interactive rendering, `ref`/`targetRef` non-leakage, empty-snapshot semantics, hard upper bound on bullet count, deterministic markdown artifact ref). `tests/read-page-l2-source-routing.test.ts` pins four routing properties (default `markdownRef = null`, opt-in routing on explicit `markdownArtifactRef`, defensive non-auto-discovery from `artifactRefs` alone, `defaultAccess` only flips for `mode='full'`).
- **Unchanged**: stable `targetRef`, the per-tab snapshot registry, the click bridge, all existing JSON output fields. Upstream callers that never set `render` see exactly the v1 payload.

### V23-04 / B-018 v1.5 — choose_context telemetry + outcome write-back + markdown branch landed (2026-04-22)

The `V23-04` package extends `tabrix_choose_context` from a stateless v1 chooser into a closed-loop v1.5 surface that can answer "did the picked strategy actually save us a `read_page` round-trip?" without giving up the v1 default behaviour.

- **Telemetry tables** (DDL in `app/native-server/src/memory/db/schema.ts`, idempotent `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS`): `tabrix_choose_context_decisions` (one row per `status='ok'` chooser call, columns `decision_id` / `intent_signature` / `page_role` / `site_family` / `strategy` / `fallback_strategy` / `created_at`) and `tabrix_choose_context_outcomes` (one row per write-back, FK to decisions). `intent_signature` is the same B-013 normalized form already used for Experience lookups; the raw `intent` string is **never** persisted.
- **Decision write-back**: `runTabrixChooseContext` appends a decision row when telemetry is wired and surfaces the new opaque `decisionId` field on `TabrixChooseContextResult`. Telemetry write failures (disk full, locked DB, …) become a missing `decisionId` field, **never** a tool error — the chooser surface stays as-good-as-v1 even when persistence is sick.
- **Outcome write-back tool**: new MCP tool `tabrix_choose_context_record_outcome` (P0, pure-INSERT, native-handled). Inputs `{decisionId, outcome}` where outcome ∈ `{reuse, fallback, completed, retried}` (closed set, validated server-side even though the JSON schema in `tools.ts` already enforces it client-side). Returns three structural statuses: `ok` (row appended), `invalid_input` (malformed args, `isError: true`), `unknown_decision` (well-formed but no matching decision row — caller distinguishes "telemetry lost" from "permission denied"). Tier-tested in `choose-context.test.ts`; risk tier registered in `TOOL_RISK_TIERS` alongside the v1 chooser.
- **Markdown reading branch**: `read_page_markdown` joins `ContextStrategyName`. The chooser routes to it when (a) no experience hit, (b) no usable knowledge catalog, (c) `siteFamily === 'github'`, (d) `pageRole` is on the new hand-curated `MARKDOWN_FRIENDLY_PAGE_ROLES` whitelist (`repo_home` shipping today; `issue_detail` / `pull_request_detail` / `discussion_detail` / `wiki` / `release_notes` / `commit_detail` pre-listed for forward-compat). Outside the whitelist the v1 fallback (`read_page_required`) is preserved so JSON-only callers see no behavior change. Markdown remains a _reading_ surface — JSON HVOs / candidateActions / `targetRef` stay the execution truth (B-015 / V23-03 invariant).
- **Release evidence**: `pnpm run release:choose-context-stats` (`scripts/release-choose-context-stats.mjs`) — read-only script that prints strategy distribution + outcome ratios from the telemetry tables. Refuses to operate on a DB that pre-dates V23-04 so the report cannot silently say "0 rows" when the table is missing. Supports `--since <ISO>`, `--json`, `--db <file>`. Suitable for hand-running before a v2.3.0 release tag.
- **Tests**: 21 new cases in `choose-context.test.ts` (markdown branch routing, telemetry decisionId surfacing, telemetry write-failure isolation, outcome runner input validation, unknown-decision branching, outcome write-failure isolation) plus 8 cases in `memory/telemetry/choose-context-telemetry.test.ts` against a real `:memory:` SQLite handle (PK collision, null fields, aggregation, `since` filter). Strategy-set guard test extended to enumerate the four v1.5 names so any future addition still requires an explicit edit here.

### Notes for incoming AI

- **Core-neutrality invariant** is guarded by `tests/read-page-understanding-core-neutrality.test.ts` — no GitHub strings in `read-page-understanding-core.ts`. Breaking this test is a blocker.
- Locator hint kinds are the same four used by `docs/MKEP_CURRENT_VS_TARGET.md:229-242`; do not add a fifth without a roadmap update.
- The phrase "`historyRef + hvoIndex + contentHash`" that earlier B-011 design notes used is **superseded** by the actual landed derivation above. Do not reintroduce `hvoIndex` into the key — index drifts with cosmetic list churn (see "Known limitations" #2 for why `historyRef` itself is also not a content hash today).

## 3. Stage 3b · Experience Phase 0 · Action Path Replay

- **Layer**: `E` (+ reads `M`)
- **KPI**: `省 token` · `更快` · `懂用户`
- **Priority**: `P0` · **Size**: `L` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3a`
- **Status**: **schema done, aggregator done, read-side MCP tool done; write-side `experience_replay` v1 landed in v2.4.0 (V24-01)** — `B-005` (schema) done in Sprint 2; `B-012` (aggregator) and `B-013` read-only `experience_suggest_plan` landed in Sprint 3; `experience_replay` v1 (bridged, P1, capability-gated, GitHub-only) shipped via V24-01 on 2026-04-22; `experience_score_step` and ranked-candidate fallback ladder remain pool (V24-02 / V24-03).

### Scope

1. Schema: `experience_action_paths(page_role, intent_signature, step_sequence, success_count, failure_count, last_used_at, …)` + `experience_locator_prefs(page_role, element_purpose, preferred_selector_kind, preferred_selector, hit_count, …)`. Done in `B-005`.
2. **Aggregator** (`B-012`, done): walks `memory_sessions` where `status ∈ {completed, failed, aborted}` AND `aggregated_at IS NULL`; joins `memory_tasks` for intent; reads `memory_steps` for ordered step sequence; and projects into `experience_action_paths`. Idempotent re-runs do not double-count.
3. `memory_sessions.aggregated_at` column added via guarded migration (SQLite lacks `IF NOT EXISTS` on `ADD COLUMN`).
4. MCP tools: `experience_suggest_plan(intent, pageRole?, limit?) → ExperienceActionPathPlan[]` shipped in `B-013` (P0 read-only, native-handled — no extension round-trip; rows ranked by `success_count` then net-success margin then recency). `experience_replay(actionPathId, variableSubstitutions, targetTabId, maxSteps) → ExperienceReplayResult` shipped in **V24-01 (v2.4.0)** as a bridged tool: `P1` + `requiresExplicitOptIn` + new capability `experience_replay`; supported step kinds restricted to `chrome_click_element` / `chrome_fill_or_select`; substitution whitelist = `['queryText','targetLabel']`; aggregator special-cases `experience_replay:<actionPathId>` task intents and projects success/failure deltas back onto the original Experience row. `experience_score_step(stepId, result)` remains an explicit follow-up (V24-02; needs Policy review before exposure).
5. Five-tier locator fallback at replay time: `exact ref → stable hash → xpath → ax name → attribute`, reordered by Experience statistics.

### Non-scope

- Writing to `experience_locator_prefs` in `B-012` — that's a follow-up item.
- Cross-user sharing / import / export (Stage 4a).
- Marketplace or community features (Stage 5d).
- Modifying Memory schema except for the `aggregated_at` column.

### Definition of Done

- `experience_suggest_plan` returns non-null for repeat GitHub tasks after ≥ 10 completed sessions on the same `(pageRole, intent)`.
- K5 (`懂用户`) measurable at ≥ 30% on the GitHub baseline (hit rate climbing toward 60% target as more runs accumulate).
- Aggregator is idempotent: running twice over the same Memory state yields identical Experience rows.
- `pnpm --filter @tabrix/tabrix test` green with ≥ 4 aggregator tests (empty / single-session / idempotent replay / failure counts).

### Linked `B-*`

- ✅ `B-005` — Experience schema seed (done).
- ✅ `B-012` — Experience action-path aggregator (done).
- ✅ `B-013` — `experience_suggest_plan` MCP tool (done; `experience_replay` / `experience_score_step` deferred — see backlog "Next" block under B-013).
- ✅ `B-EXP-REPLAY-V1` — `experience_replay` v1 **landed in v2.4.0 (V24-01, 2026-04-22)** via bridged MCP tool + capability gate + aggregator special-case + chooser branch. Owner decisions of 2026-04-23 shipped as-locked; see `docs/B_EXPERIENCE_REPLAY_BRIEF_V1.md` §10 + `.claude/handoffs/v2_4_0_v24_01_experience_replay_v1.md`. Real-browser acceptance scenarios (`t5-G-experience-replay`) ride a sibling PR in `tabrix-private-tests`.

### Notes for incoming AI

- Tabrix is **execution layer, not Agent** (PRD §1, P4). `experience_suggest_plan` returns a plan — the upstream LLM decides to adopt or not. Do not add "auto-pick the plan" logic in Tabrix.
- `intent_signature` normalization is the hidden hard part: "list issues in repo X" and "show issues from repo X" must hash to the same bucket. Current v1 is intentionally light (lowercase + trim + collapse spaces); revisit only when bucket quality evidence requires it.
- The `step_sequence` JSON in B-012 v1 is `{ toolName, status, historyRef }` — preserve `historyRef` so replay can re-fetch the same page snapshot.

## 4. Stage 3c · Recovery Watchdog Consolidation

- **Layer**: `E` + `P`
- **KPI**: `更稳` · `更准`
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: none (can run in parallel with Wave 1)
- **Status**: pool — `B-014`.

### Scope

1. `RecoveryWatchdog` interface: `{ trigger, pageRoleScope, recoverySteps, cooldownMs }`.
2. Migrate four existing fallbacks to watchdog pattern:
   - `dialog-prearm.ts` — native dialog auto-accept / dismiss.
   - `interaction.ts` — click / fill fallback on stale refs.
   - `screenshot.ts` — CDP → content-script fallback.
   - `read-page.ts` — sparse-tree fallback.
3. Reserve — not implement — extension points for `captcha` / `rate-limit` / `stale-session` / `login-expired`.
4. Optional: add session-level mutex (à la `mcp-server-browserbase`) if the watchdog flow reveals races.

### Non-scope

- Implementing captcha or rate-limit watchdogs.
- Changing any tool's public contract.
- Centralizing unrelated state machines.

### Definition of Done

- The four existing fallbacks compile through a single `RecoveryWatchdog` interface.
- No change in tool behaviour (regression tests green).
- `docs/TESTING.md` documents how to inject a synthetic failure to test a watchdog.
- K4 (`更稳`) baseline for `bridge recovery failure rate` captured in Memory for future comparison.

### Linked `B-*`

- ⬜ `B-014` — Recovery Watchdog table consolidation.

### Notes for incoming AI

- This is a **refactor** — do not let it become "add six new watchdogs in one PR." Scope is _consolidate existing four_, not _add new_.
- `cooldownMs` must be respected per page/session; a broken cooldown makes the watchdog oscillate.
- Add an `architecture-debt-review` per `AGENTS.md` rule 15 after three consecutive commits on this Stage.

## 5. Stage 3d · `read_page(render='markdown')` + Agent Step Envelope

- **Layer**: `K` + `M`
- **KPI**: `省 token`
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `S` · **Dependencies**: none
- **Status**: v1 done (2026-04-22, V23-03) — `B-015` v1 landed end-to-end. See §"V23-03 / B-015 — Markdown render path + L2 source routing landed (2026-04-22)" above for the landing note. Remaining pool work: `agentStep` JSON schema publish (Scope item 3) and the `memory_page_snapshots.readable_markdown` lazy column (Scope item 2).

### Scope

1. `chrome_read_page(render = 'json' | 'markdown')` — default stays `json`; no breaking change. **Landed v1 (2026-04-22).**
2. `memory_page_snapshots.readable_markdown` column (lazy-computed on demand). _Pool — not landed in v1._
3. Optional: `agentStep` envelope JSON schema published to `packages/shared/src/` for MCP clients that want to embed the schema in a prompt. _Pool — not landed in v1._

### Non-scope

- HTML → markdown rules beyond what the existing `get_web_content` tool already does.
- Adding a new MCP tool.
- Changing the default render.

### Definition of Done

- `render='markdown'` round-trips through `read_page`; p95 token count for the GitHub baseline is ≥ 40% below `render='json'`.
- Snapshot recall: if the same page returns `render='markdown'` twice, the markdown is stable (same `contentHash` → same bytes).
- `pnpm --filter @tabrix/extension test` adds ≥ 5 tests.

### Linked `B-*`

- ✅ `B-015` v1 — `read_page(render='markdown')` + unit tests landed 2026-04-22 (V23-03). Scope items 2 (snapshot column) and 3 (`agentStep` envelope publish) remain pool.

### Notes for incoming AI

- The markdown path must not bypass the HVO extractor — upstream LLMs still want `highValueObjects[]` even when prose is markdown. The response shape becomes `{ render: 'markdown', markdown: string, highValueObjects: [...] }`.
- Do not reintroduce `@tabrix/markdown-worker` or similar deleted surfaces without a governance decision (`AGENTS.md` → Removed Surfaces).

## 6. Stage 3e · Run History UI (Sidepanel "Memory" Tab)

- **Layer**: `M`
- **KPI**: `懂用户` (operator/self-diagnose value)
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: none
- **Status**: **DONE** — Sprint 1+2 shipped the core surface.

### Scope (shipped)

- `B-001` — Native-server `/memory/*` read API (sessions list, steps drill-down, task fetch).
- `B-002` — Sidepanel Memory tab session list (paginated, status colour dot, step count pill, duration).
- `B-003` — Session → step drill-down with per-step status, tool name, duration, error surfacing, "Copy historyRef" button.
- `B-006` — Status filter chips + search + "jump to last failure" button.

### Non-scope (deferred)

- Server-side search (`GET /memory/sessions?q=`) — future backlog candidate.
- Virtual scrolling — paginate instead (20 rows/page default, cap 500).
- Variable-snapshot inspector (comes back under a different Stage once Experience aggregates it).

### Definition of Done

- ✅ Sidepanel Memory tab renders 20 recent sessions by default; clicking expands to steps; copying `historyRef` works; filter + search + jump-to-failure all functional.
- ✅ No re-introduction of the removed Smart Assistant / AgentChat surface.
- ✅ Bundle size under the 25/40 kB JS and 20/22 kB CSS gates (`scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`).

### Linked `B-*` (all `done`)

- ✅ `B-001`, `B-002`, `B-003`, `B-006`.

### Notes for incoming AI

- Future Memory-tab features (variable snapshots, action-path visualiser) must reuse the `useMemoryTimeline` composable — do not fork state management.
- The composable was deliberately placed under `entrypoints/shared/composables/` so the popup can later consume the same source.

## 7. Stage 3f · Policy Capability Opt-in Standardisation

- **Layer**: `P` + `M`
- **KPI**: `更稳` (auditability)
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `S` · **Dependencies**: none
- **Status**: `v1 done (2026-04-22)` — `B-016`. v1 ships the enum + env parser only; per-tool capability annotations and the `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3` ↔ `TABRIX_POLICY_CAPABILITIES` migration are intentionally deferred to keep v1 surgical for `B-017`.

### Scope

1. `TabrixCapability` enum (v1: `api_knowledge`; future capabilities `vision | elevated_js | download | devtools | testing | cross_origin_nav` will land per-feature, not as a big-bang renaming).
2. Each P2/P3 tool declares its required capability (`tools.ts`). **Deferred — orthogonal to v1; the v1 gate is feature-level (e.g. API Knowledge capture), not tool-level.**
3. Env: `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3` → `TABRIX_POLICY_CAPABILITIES` (back-compat for ≥ 6 months). **Deferred — v1 introduces `TABRIX_POLICY_CAPABILITIES` as an _additional_ gate that runs alongside `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3`; no migration / no deprecation path is enforced yet.**
4. `MemoryAction.policyCapabilities` field (for the Insights tab and future audits). **Deferred.**
5. Hook for Stage 4b's origin/siteId dynamic policy (reserved interface, no implementation yet). **Deferred.**

### Non-scope

- Per-siteId dynamic policy (Stage 4b).
- UI for capability toggling (sidepanel Policy surface is later).
- Breaking the existing `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3` env.

### Definition of Done

- All P3 tools have a named capability; `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3=1` still unlocks them all for back-compat.
- `packages/shared/src/tools.ts` publishes `TabrixCapability`.
- Native-server policy gate reads capability from the tool annotation, not a separate table.
- `pnpm -r typecheck` and gate tests green.

### Linked `B-*`

- ⬜ `B-016` — `TabrixCapability` enum + env migration.

### Notes for incoming AI

- Policy-layer changes are owner-lane work per `AGENTS.md` "Tiered Execution Model" → "Fast-lane must not do" §2. Any AI assistant that picks this up must stay in owner-lane (design → write it down → then execute), not delegate it down to a mechanical fast-lane pass.
- Keep the deprecation friendly: if `TABRIX_POLICY_ALLOW_P3=1` is set, keep unlocking P3 for six months, and log a deprecation warning once per process.

## 8. Stage 3g · API Knowledge · Network-Layer Awareness

> **The biggest competitive gap today** — zero surveyed competitor treats site APIs as first-class Knowledge.

- **Layer**: `K` + `P`
- **KPI**: `省 token` (largest) · `更快` · `更准`
- **Priority**: `P0` · **Size**: `L` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3f` (capability framework)
- **Status**: `v1 done (2026-04-22)` — `B-017`. v1 ships **GitHub-first, capture-only**; `knowledge_call_api`, the per-site Sidepanel toggle, JSON-Schema inference and cross-site coverage are intentionally **out** for v1 and remain in the pool.

### v1 landed (2026-04-22)

- New `knowledge_api_endpoints` table (idempotent migration; dedup by `(site, endpoint_signature)` with `sample_count` / `first_seen_at` / `last_seen_at` provenance).
- Pure transformer in `app/native-server/src/memory/knowledge/api-knowledge-capture.ts`: 9 GitHub families covered (issues / pulls / actions runs / actions workflows / search/issues / search/repositories / repo metadata + their `:number` / `:run_id` detail variants), plus an `unclassified` fallback that still respects redaction.
- Wired through a new `chrome_network_capture` post-processor — **no MCP surface change**, no extension change. Capture is gated on capability `api_knowledge`; default off.
- Hard PII guarantees (regression-tested at three layers — pure transformer, repository, post-processor): never persists raw header values, cookies, query values, request body values, or response body text. Only header _names_, query _keys_, body _keys_, presence flags (`hasAuth` / `hasCookie`), and a coarse response shape descriptor.

### Scope

1. **Capture layer**: opt-in XHR/fetch listener (`chrome.debugger.attach` + `Network.requestWillBeSent/responseReceived`). Default **off**, gated by capability `knowledge.capture_api`.
2. **Aggregation layer**: collapse repeated requests into `KnowledgeApiEndpoint`:
   ```ts
   interface KnowledgeApiEndpoint {
     siteId: string;
     pageRole?: string;
     method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE';
     urlPattern: string; // /api/v3/repos/:owner/:repo/issues
     requestSchema?: JsonSchema;
     responseSchema?: JsonSchema;
     paginationHint?: 'offset' | 'cursor' | 'none';
     authRequired?: boolean;
     rateLimitHint?: string;
     seenCount: number;
     lastSeenAt: string;
   }
   ```
3. **MCP tools**:
   - `knowledge_describe_api(siteId, pageRole?) → endpoints[]`.
   - `knowledge_call_api(endpointId, params)` — reuses the user's real Chrome cookies (the moat: cloud browsers cannot).
4. **Privacy / Policy**:
   - Default off; Sidepanel shows an explicit opt-in switch per `siteId`.
   - PII redaction (`token` / `password` / `email` patterns) runs **before** the row lands in SQLite.
   - Per-site on/off.
5. **Milestone**: GitHub first — cover `issues`, `actions`, `workflow_runs`, `prs`, `contents` (5 endpoints).

### Non-scope

- Cross-user / cross-machine API catalog sharing (out — siteId-level sharing of `urlPattern` and `responseSchema` only; no payload sharing).
- Non-HTTP protocols (WebSocket, SSE) — later.
- Auto-calling APIs the user has not explicitly opted into.

### Definition of Done

- On GitHub, after one capture session, `knowledge_describe_api(siteId: 'github.com')` returns ≥ 5 endpoints with valid JSON schemas.
- `knowledge_call_api` round-trips against at least `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/issues` using real cookies.
- Privacy test: PII fixtures (`authorization: Bearer …`, `password: …`, `email: foo@bar.com`) never land in the SQLite row.
- A fresh install has the capability disabled; opting in is a conscious Sidepanel action.

### Linked `B-*`

- ✅ `B-017` v1 — capture-only, GitHub-first, capability-gated, PII-safe (landed 2026-04-22). Remaining v2 work (call layer, JSON-Schema inference, Sidepanel per-site toggle, additional sites) stays in the pool under the same `B-017` umbrella; spin out a sub-ID when v2 is sequenced.

### Notes for incoming AI

- `chrome.debugger.attach` is a P3 path (per PRD §1, P3 low-footprint pillar). This Stage is an **intentional, opted-in P3 branch** — keep the opt-in default off, and never leave debugger attached on tab close.
- PII redact must run **before** `INSERT` — adding a post-hoc scrubber is not acceptable (privacy leaks happen between capture and redact otherwise).
- GitHub API surface is the MVP; do not add Douyin / Xiaohongshu endpoints until GitHub is Beta.

## 9. Stage 3h · Context Strategy Selector

> **The single largest `省 token` lever on the planning side.**

- **Layer**: `K` + `E`
- **KPI**: `省 token` (largest) · `更快` · `懂用户`
- **Priority**: `P0` · **Size**: `L` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3a` + `Stage 3b` + `Stage 3d` + `Stage 3g` all at least `Beta`
- **Status**: v1 minimal slice landed 2026-04-22 — `B-018` (rule-based selector wired as native `tabrix_choose_context`; details in `docs/B_018_CONTEXT_SELECTOR_V1.md`). Full Stage 3h DoD (decision table, telemetry, multi-site) still pool.

### Scope

1. New MCP tool `tabrix_choose_context(intent, url?, constraints?) → ContextBundle`:
   ```ts
   interface ContextBundle {
     strategy:
       | 'api_only'
       | 'knowledge_light'
       | 'read_page_markdown'
       | 'read_page_json'
       | 'experience_replay'
       | 'read_page_json_plus_ui_map';
     reasoning: string;
     artifacts: Array<{
       kind:
         | 'experience'
         | 'knowledge_api'
         | 'knowledge_ui_map'
         | 'read_page'
         | 'markdown'
         | 'historyRef';
       payload: unknown;
       tokenEstimate: number;
     }>;
     tokenBudget: number;
     fallbackStrategy?: string;
   }
   ```
2. Rule table (seed data in Knowledge Registry):
   `intent pattern × siteId known? × pageRole known? × has Experience? × has API Knowledge? → strategy`.
3. Self-learning: every adopted strategy + its outcome (success/fail, duration, tokens) writes back to Memory; next call re-ranks by success rate.
4. Stage 3h is the **consumer** of Experience (Stage 3b is the producer).

### Non-scope

- Writing strategy preferences back to Knowledge Registry seed (Stage 5a).
- Server-side model to pick strategies — rule-based only in v1.
- Cross-user strategy sharing.

### Definition of Done

- For the top-10 repeat GitHub intents, `tabrix_choose_context` picks `api_only` or `experience_replay` (not `read_page_json`) in ≥ 70% of calls once Stage 3g + 3b are Beta.
- Aggregate token cost on the GitHub baseline drops by ≥ 25% vs. the pre-3h line (measured via MCP-side input-token tallies).
- Rule table is data, not code — adding a rule does not require a TS edit.

### Linked `B-*`

- 🟡 `B-018` — `tabrix_choose_context` v1 minimal slice landed (rule-based selector, GitHub-first, three strategies). Seed decision table + multi-site coverage still open. See `docs/B_018_CONTEXT_SELECTOR_V1.md`.

### Notes for incoming AI

- This Stage is valuable **only when its four dependencies are at least Beta**. Starting it early produces `read_page_json` as the default fallback every time — no K1 movement.
- Do not turn this into "Tabrix is now an agent." It picks a context, not a next step.

## 10. Stage 3i · Memory Insights Table + Sidepanel Insights Tab

- **Layer**: `M` + `E`
- **KPI**: `更准` (long-term)
- **Priority**: `P2` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3e` (shared Sidepanel UI layer)
- **Status**: pool — `B-019`.

### Scope

1. New table `memory_insights`:
   ```ts
   interface MemoryInsight {
     id: string;
     type:
       | 'unexpected_failure'
       | 'locator_flaky'
       | 'retry_loop'
       | 'fallback_triggered'
       | 'policy_denied'
       | 'api_schema_drift';
     severity: 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
     siteId?: string;
     pageRole?: string;
     toolName?: string;
     sampleSessionId: string;
     sampleActionId: string;
     occurrences: number;
     suggestion?: string;
     firstSeenAt: string;
     lastSeenAt: string;
     status: 'new' | 'acknowledged' | 'copied_to_issue' | 'wont_fix';
   }
   ```
2. Sidepanel "Insights" tab — severity-sorted list, dedup + occurrences count, one-click "copy as issue markdown" (clipboard only, **no network**).
3. Aggregation: periodic scan of recent Memory rows flags the six `type` patterns above.

### Non-scope

- Auto-filing GitHub issues (PRD §8 — never, until `AGENTS.md` governance decision).
- Anonymous telemetry upload — Stage 5+ candidate.
- ML-based anomaly detection — static rules only in v1.

### Definition of Done

- `memory_insights` is written to for all six `type` values on synthetic fixtures.
- Sidepanel Insights tab renders + copies markdown; clipboard round-trip verified.
- No network request originates from this Stage.

### Linked `B-*`

- ⬜ `B-019` — `memory_insights` table + Sidepanel tab.

### Notes for incoming AI

- **Never** add a "file this upstream" button in v1. Clipboard-only is a product invariant.
- Copy-as-issue markdown should include `historyRef`, page URL, tool name, occurrence count, first/last seen — enough for a human to triage without opening Tabrix.

## 11. Stage 4a · Experience Local Import / Export (Community Seeding)

- **Layer**: `E`
- **KPI**: `懂用户` (long-term community compounding)
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3b` at `Beta`
- **Status**: pool — `B-020`.

### Scope

1. `experience_export(taskIntent | pageRole | all) → JSON file`.
2. `experience_import(file) → diff + dry-run + user confirm`.
3. **PII redact** pre-export: regex-match `password | token | authorization | cookie | session` (case-insensitive) and strip unless the user opts to keep.
4. Schema versioning: `experienceSchemaVersion: 1`; cross-version auto-migrate on import.
5. Trust: import forces a `dry-run` preview listing the locator prefs / action paths that would be overwritten; user confirms before any write.

### Non-scope

- Networked marketplace / community ratings / remote pull (Stage 5d).
- Differential diff UI beyond "added X, overwriting Y".
- Signing / notarization (Stage 5d).

### Definition of Done

- Round-trip export → import on the same machine preserves the `(pageRole, intent)` buckets bit-exact.
- PII regex test: injected secrets in Memory are absent from the export file.
- Dry-run is not bypassable (no "force import" flag).

### Linked `B-*`

- ⬜ `B-020` — `experience_export` / `experience_import` + redact + dry-run.

### Notes for incoming AI

- Marketplace / networked sharing is explicitly later. Stage 4a is **local file** only. Do not add a "publish" button.
- PII redact defaults to "strip"; the user must explicitly opt in to keep secrets — never the other way around.

## 12. Stage 4b · Policy Dynamic Context

- **Layer**: `P`
- **KPI**: `更稳` · `更准`
- **Priority**: `P1` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3f` + `Stage 3g` + Memory aggregation ready
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

1. `PolicyContext = { toolName, pageRole, siteId, recentFailureRate, apiEndpointCalled }` passed into every gate call.
2. Dynamic re-tiering: e.g. `chrome_javascript` is P2 on `github.com/issues`, but P3 on `bank.com`.
3. User-level override layer — individuals can **tighten** policy (not loosen — loosening is a repo owner call).
4. Audit log UI (subset of `memory_insights`).

### Non-scope

- Machine learning on policy decisions — static rules + Memory signals only.
- Cross-organisation policy sharing.

### Definition of Done

- Policy decisions referenced in Memory include full `PolicyContext` (searchable in Insights).
- At least one working re-tier rule (e.g. `chrome_javascript` on `bank.com` is P3 even when env allows P3 globally on GitHub — demonstrable).

### Notes for incoming AI

- Do not weaken any existing P3 tool as a side-effect. Re-tier should be one-way (stricter) unless the repo owner explicitly opts in via PR.

## 13. Stage 4c · Knowledge Stage 4 · Douyin + Cross-Site Family

- **Layer**: `K`
- **KPI**: `更准` (coverage expansion)
- **Priority**: `P2` · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: `Stage 3a` stable
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

1. Migrate all rules in `read-page-understanding-douyin.ts` (and Creator Center) to Registry seeds.
2. Abstract a "Video/Social family" (Douyin, Bilibili, YouTube share patterns: feed, creator panel, comments, upload).
3. Retire hardcoded TS adapters where Registry covers them.

### Non-scope

- Adding a new family (e.g. "search engine family") in the same Stage.
- Public benchmarks against competitors on non-GitHub sites (later).

### Definition of Done

- All Douyin TS adapter code goes through `docs/KNOWLEDGE_STAGE_1.md` + `STAGE_2.md` Registry paths.
- Parity test on Douyin matches the pre-migration TS adapter output byte-for-byte on representative fixtures.

### Notes for incoming AI

- Any Douyin-specific fixture lives in the private `tabrix-private-tests` repo, **not** this repo (`AGENTS.md` rule 17).
- Do not paste real Douyin DOM into a public test file.

---

## 14. Stage 5a · Experience Self-Learning Writeback

- **Layer**: `K` + `E`
- **KPI**: `懂用户` · `更准`
- **Priority**: future · **Size**: `L` · **Dependencies**: Stage 3b + 3h stable for ≥ one sprint
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

Tabrix automatically mines successful locator / path preferences from Memory + Experience and writes candidate rows to a **Knowledge candidate area**. A human (repo maintainer) reviews before promoting to Registry seed.

### Non-scope

- Automatic writeback without human review.
- Cross-user pooled learning (would break privacy invariants).

### Definition of Done

- The repo maintainer runs a weekly review pass; ≥ 5 candidate rows / week on active sites.
- No `memory_insights` row for `api_schema_drift` or `locator_flaky` triggers a direct Knowledge write without human approval.

---

## 15. Stage 5b · Knowledge Graph Upgrade

- **Layer**: `K`
- **KPI**: `更准` · `懂用户`
- **Priority**: future · **Size**: `XL` · **Dependencies**: Stage 3a + 3g + 4c all stable
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

Upgrade the flat Registry tables into a graph: `Site × Page × Object × Action × API`, with edges `LINKS_TO` / `HAS_REGION` / `CONTAINS_OBJECT` / `LEADS_TO` / `SUCCEEDS` (inspired by GitNexus schema). Enables:

- "next candidate action" inference.
- Similar-path recall.
- Failure-path avoidance.

### Non-scope

- Vector embeddings over the graph (Stage 5+, and only if semantic search returns to the roadmap).
- Externalising to Neo4j / a separate graph DB — graph runs on top of existing SQLite.

### Definition of Done

- TBD — pending Stage 5a maturity.

---

## 16. Stage 5c · WebMCP Bridge

- **Layer**: `X`
- **KPI**: `更快` · `省 token`
- **Priority**: future · **Size**: `L` · **Dependencies**: WebMCP standardisation externally
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

When a site ships WebMCP endpoints, Tabrix acts as a bridge: forward to WebMCP if present; fall back to `read_page + HVO` otherwise.

### Non-scope

- Implementing WebMCP ourselves before it stabilises externally.
- Site-side WebMCP injection.

### Definition of Done

- TBD — pending WebMCP spec maturity.

---

## 17. Stage 5d · Experience Marketplace

- **Layer**: `E`
- **KPI**: `懂用户`
- **Priority**: future · **Size**: `XL` · **Dependencies**: Stage 4a stable for ≥ 6 months
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

Signed + trust-scored + community-distributed Experience bundles. Networked import/export with provenance and malicious-recipe detection.

### Non-scope

- Until Stage 4a (local import/export) has shipped and matured.
- Monetisation.

### Definition of Done

- TBD — pending Stage 4a maturity.

### Notes for incoming AI

Anything labelled "marketplace" before Stage 4a is green for ≥ 6 months is premature; block the PR and ask.

---

## 18. Stage 5e · Personal `userPreference` Layer

- **Layer**: `M`
- **KPI**: `懂用户`
- **Priority**: future · **Size**: `M` · **Dependencies**: Memory has accumulated ≥ 3 months of data
- **Status**: no `B-*` yet.

### Scope

Memory gains `user_preferences { key, value, sourceSessionId, confidence }` — captured from recurring patterns (e.g. "user always picks repo X when asked about issues").

### Non-scope

- Cross-user pooling.
- Marketing copy that calls this "personalisation" before the column exists.

### Definition of Done

- TBD.

---

## 19. Cross-Cutting Tracks (Not Stage-Scoped)

### 19.1 Tool-contract correctness

Inspired by `B-023` (`chrome_click_element` false-success defect). Every tool ships a response contract that distinguishes:

- `dispatchSucceeded` — did the content-script path even run?
- `observedOutcome` — what actually changed (enum: `cross_document_navigation | spa_route_change | hash_change | new_tab_opened | dialog_opened | menu_opened | state_toggled | selection_changed | dom_changed | focus_changed | download_intercepted | no_observed_change | verification_unavailable`).
- `verification` — raw signal booleans.
- `success` — derived, never synonymous with "the promise resolved".

**Next candidates**: `chrome_fill_or_select`, `chrome_keyboard`, `chrome_navigate` need the same treatment, each as its own `B-*`.

### 19.2 Infrastructure guardrails

- `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` — JS 25/40 kB, CSS 20/22 kB (B-007 + B-021).
- Schema-cite rule for any Memory / Knowledge / Experience or shared DTO touch (B-009).
- `docs/EXTENSION_TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md` — `fetch` / `AbortController` / `chrome.storage` patterns (B-008).
- Architecture-review checkpoint every 3 consecutive `feat:` / `fix:` commits on the same MKEP layer (`AGENTS.md` rule 15).

### 19.3 Removed-surface invariant

Before adding any MCP tool / background listener / sidepanel tab / shared type, check against `AGENTS.md` → Removed Surfaces. If the change resurrects any of those surfaces **under any name**, stop and surface the question.

## 20. Current-Sprint Snapshot (2026-W19 · Sprint 3)

(Live snapshot — update at each sprint review; authoritative copy is in [`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`](./PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md).)

| Sprint         | State               | Items                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sprint 1 (W17) | `closed 2026-04-20` | `B-001..B-004` all done.                                                          |
| Sprint 2 (W18) | `closed 2026-04-20` | `B-005..B-009` all done.                                                          |

### Next sprint candidates (Sprint 4, seeded from pool)

Pick in this order unless something blocks:

1. `B-015` follow-on — Stage 3d Scope items 2 + 3 (`memory_page_snapshots.readable_markdown` lazy column + `agentStep` envelope JSON schema publish). `B-015` v1 (the `render='markdown'` parameter) landed 2026-04-22 (V23-03); only the optional persistence + envelope tail remains.
2. `B-018` v2 — full Stage 3h DoD on top of the v1 selector (now also able to consume `B-011` stable `targetRef`).
3. Stage 3a follow-up — UI Map consumer cutover inside `candidate-action.ts` (Stage 3a item 6, deferred from `B-011`).
4. Stage 3b write-side follow-up — `experience_replay` v1 **landed in v2.4.0 (V24-01)**; `experience_score_step` + composite session score (V24-02) and ranked-candidate fallback ladder (V24-03) remain follow-ups (needs Policy review first; not a single backlog ID yet).

`B-011` v1 landed 2026-04-22 (stable HVO `targetRef` end-to-end: extension emits `tgt_<10-hex>`, click bridge resolves stable→snapshot ref via per-tab registry, real-browser golden path `T5-F-GH-STABLE-TARGETREF-ROUNDTRIP` green).

`B-016` and `B-017` v1 landed 2026-04-22 (capture-only, GitHub-first, capability-gated). v2 work for `B-017` (call layer / JSON-Schema inference / Sidepanel per-site toggle) is intentionally **not** in the next-sprint candidates yet — sequence it after `B-018` proves the read side is actually used.
